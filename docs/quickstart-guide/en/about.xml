   <title>About HornetQ</title>
    <para>The goal of HornetQ is simple and uncompromising: to bring unrivaled levels of
        performance and reliability to messaging, and to be the fastest, best featured, and most
        scalable multi-protocol messaging system.</para>
    <para>Why use HornetQ? Here are a few of the reasons:</para>
    <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
            <para>100% open source software.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Written in Java. Runs on any platform with a J2SE 5.0 JDK, that's everything from
                Windows desktops to IBM mainframes.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Superb performance. Our class beating high performance journal provides persistent
                messaging performance at rates normally seen for non persistent messaging.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Full feature set. All the features you'd expect in any serious messaging system,
                and others you won't find anywhere else.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Elegant POJO based design with minimal third party dependencies. Run HornetQ
                stand-alone, run it in integrated in your favourite Java EE Application
                Server or IoC container, or run it embedded inside your own product.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Seamless high availability. We provide server replication and completely
                transparent client failover so you don't have to worry about coding your client
                specially for an HA environment.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Hugely flexible clustering. Create clusters of servers that know how to load
                balance messages. Link geographically distributed clusters over unreliable
                connections to form a global network. Configure routing of messages in a highly
                flexible way.</para>
