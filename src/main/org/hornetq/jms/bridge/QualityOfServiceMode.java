 *       by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *       Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *       with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *       institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *       cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *       or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *       or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *       granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *       as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *       Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *       modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *       meet the following conditions:

 *           attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *           excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *           the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *       (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *           distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *           include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *           within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *           pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *           of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *           as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *           documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *           within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *           wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *           of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *           do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *           notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *           or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *           that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *           as modifying the License.
 *
 *       You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *       may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *       for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *       for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *       reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *       the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *       by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *       this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *       Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *       the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *       with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *       names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *       except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *       origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *       agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *       Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *       WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *       implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *       of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *       PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *       appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *       risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *       whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *       unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *       negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *       the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *       and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *       or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *       License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *       on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *       of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *       defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *       incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *       of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

/**
 * <h3>Quality of server (QoS) levels</h3>
 * 
 * <h4>QOS_AT_MOST_ONCE</h4>
 * 
 * With this QoS mode messages will reach the destination from the source at
 * most once. The messages are consumed from the source and acknowledged before
 * sending to the destination. Therefore there is a possibility that if failure
 * occurs between removing them from the source and them arriving at the
 * destination they could be lost. Hence delivery will occur at most once. This
 * mode is avilable for both persistent and non persistent messages.
 * 
 * <h4>QOS_DUPLICATES_OK</h4>
 * 
 * With this QoS mode, the messages are consumed from the source and then
 * acknowledged after they have been successfully sent to the destination.
 * Therefore there is a possibility that if failure occurs after sending to the
 * destination but before acknowledging them, they could be sent again when the
 * system recovers. I.e. the destination might receive duplicates after a
 * failure. This mode is available for both persistent and non persistent
 * messages.
 * 
 * <h4>QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE</h4>
 * 
 * This QoS mode ensures messages will reach the destination from the source
 * once and only once. (Sometimes this mode is known as "exactly once"). If both
 * the source and the destination are on the same JBoss Messaging server
 * instance then this can be achieved by sending and acknowledging the messages
 * in the same local transaction. If the source and destination are on different
 * servers this is achieved by enlisting the sending and consuming sessions in a
 * JTA transaction. The JTA transaction is controlled by JBoss Transactions JTA
 * implementation which is a fully recovering transaction manager, thus
 * providing a very high degree of durability. If JTA is required then both
 * supplied connection factories need to be XAConnectionFactory implementations.
 * This mode is only available for persistent messages. This is likely to be the
 * slowest mode since it requires extra persistence for the transaction logging.
 * 
 * Note: For a specific application it may possible to provide once and only
 * once semantics without using the QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE QoS level. This can
 * be done by using the QOS_DUPLICATES_OK mode and then checking for duplicates
 * at the destination and discarding them. Some JMS servers provide automatic
 * duplicate message detection functionality, or this may be possible to
 * implement on the application level by maintaining a cache of received message
 * ids on disk and comparing received messages to them. The cache would only be
 * valid for a certain period of time so this approach is not as watertight as
 * using QOS_ONCE_AND_ONLY_ONCE but may be a good choice depending on your
 * specific application.
