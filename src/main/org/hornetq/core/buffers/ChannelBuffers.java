 *
 *    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *       any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work

 *       liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *       incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *       result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *       Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *       work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *       other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *       has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

package org.hornetq.core.buffers;

import java.nio.ByteBuffer;

/**
 * Creates a new {@link ChannelBuffer} by allocating new space or by wrapping
 * or copying existing byte arrays, byte buffers and a string.
 *
 * <h3>Use static import</h3>
 * This classes is intended to be used with Java 5 static import statement:
 *
 * <pre>
 * import static org.jboss.netty.buffer.ChannelBuffers.*;
 *
 * ChannelBuffer heapBuffer = buffer(128);
 * ChannelBuffer directBuffer = directBuffer(256);
 * ChannelBuffer dynamicBuffer = dynamicBuffer(512);
 * ChannelBuffer wrappedBuffer = wrappedBuffer(new byte[128], new byte[256]);
 * ChannelBuffer copiedBuffer = copiedBuffer(ByteBuffer.allocate(128));
 * </pre>
 *
 * <h3>Allocating a new buffer</h3>
 *
 * Three buffer types are provided out of the box.
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link #buffer(int)} allocates a new fixed-capacity heap buffer.</li>
 * <li>{@link #directBuffer(int)} allocates a new fixed-capacity direct buffer.</li>
 * <li>{@link #dynamicBuffer(int)} allocates a new dynamic-capacity heap
 *     buffer, whose capacity increases automatically as needed by a write
 *     operation.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Creating a wrapped buffer</h3>
 *
 * Wrapped buffer is a buffer which is a view of one or more existing
 * byte arrays and byte buffers.  Any changes in the content of the original
 * array or buffer will be reflected in the wrapped buffer.  Various wrapper
 * methods are provided and their name is all {@code wrappedBuffer()}.
 * You might want to take a look at this method closely if you want to create
 * a buffer which is composed of more than one array to reduce the number of
 * memory copy.
 *
 * <h3>Creating a copied buffer</h3>
 *
 * Copied buffer is a deep copy of one or more existing byte arrays, byte
 * buffers or a string.  Unlike a wrapped buffer, there's no shared data
 * between the original data and the copied buffer.  Various copy methods are
 * provided and their name is all {@code copiedBuffer()}.  It is also convenient
 * to use this operation to merge multiple buffers into one buffer.
 *
 * <h3>Miscellaneous utility methods</h3>
 *
 * This class also provides various utility methods to help implementation
 * of a new buffer type, generation of hex dump and swapping an integer's
 * byte order.
